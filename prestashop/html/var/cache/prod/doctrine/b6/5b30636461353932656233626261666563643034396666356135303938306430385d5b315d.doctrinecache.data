The &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders<\/strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>\r\nIn presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHighly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>\r\nThe second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback.

On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to&nbsp;<b>further<\/b>&nbsp;enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on&nbsp;<b>your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...)<\/b>.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of&nbsp;<b>dynamic retargeting<\/b>. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking).<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>For an even more accurate analysis of the effectiveness of your ads and an even better tracking of the buying journey, <b>activate the conversions API<\/b> in addition to the Pixel to send the data directly from your store's server!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The power of Facebook also allows you&nbsp;<b>to acquire new customers<\/b>&nbsp;by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>OFFER A LOCALIZED VERSION OF YOUR ADS AND YOUR FACEBOOK SHOP<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Our module allows you to use&nbsp;<b>Facebook's country feeds<\/b>&nbsp;to offer multi-country and multi-lingual Facebook and Instagram users&nbsp;<b>a Shop and ads adapted to their location.<\/b>&nbsp;For example, a Facebook user in the US will see your product data in English and prices in dollars in your Facebook Store, while a French user will see the same information in French and Euros.
